# Workday Calculator

This app is meant to tell you what time you can leave work depending on what time you arrive, your lunch break
 (assuming you don't get paid for lunch), and the hours you intend to work that day.
 
 1. Set the time you arrived at work
 2. Add the expected length of you lunch break in minutes (0 if you skip lunch)
 3. Set the hours you intend to work for the day. The default is 8, but should be changed if you plan on working
  overtime or having a shorter day
  
  Obviously, if things change during the day such as an extra long lunch or an unexpected task comes up, just change
   the parameters and recalculate.
